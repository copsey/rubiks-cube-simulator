# Rubik's Cube Simulator

A program for simulating a Rubik's Cube in 3D. You can:
- rotate faces by any number of turns that you want,
- left-click on a sticker and choose a new colour,
- automatically reorient the cube (so that a certain face points forward, and a certain face points up),
- manually orient the cube by right-clicking and dragging, and
- zoom in and out by scrolling.

Supports anywhere from 1x1 to 5x5 cube sizes.

_Note:_ Due to using Swift and Xcode, it only works on Macs. Also make sure that you're running a version of macOS that supports OpenGL 2.
